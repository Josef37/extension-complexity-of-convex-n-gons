\section{Lower Bounds for the Extension Complexity}
% todo @ March 11

\begin{itemize}
  \item overview of this section
  \item proof of lower bound using \cite{averkov2016maximum} with familiy of polygons on circle
  \item (maybe) multi-dimensional proof (find a appropriate familiy)
  \item overview of used theorem (how to apply, idea behind it)
\end{itemize}
