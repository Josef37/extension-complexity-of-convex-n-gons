\section{Concluding Remarks}

In this paper we looked at the best known bounds for the extension complexity of polygons.

For cyclic polygons $P$ we know $\xc(P) \in \Theta(n^{1/2})$.

For arbitrary polygons $P$, we only know $\xc(P) \in \Omega(n^{1/2}) \cap O(n^{2/3})$.

\citeauthor{kwan2020extension} conjectured that cyclic polygons have worst-case extension complexity, i.e.\ $\xc(P) \in \Theta(n^{1/2})$, because they ``seem to represent quite a diverse cross-section of the space of all polygons'' \cite[3]{kwan2020extension}.

On the other hand, \citeauthor{shitov2020sublinear} expected that $\pc(n) = n^{1/2} \cdot \alpha(n)$ with unbounded $\alpha(n)$ \cite[Conjecture 61]{shitov2020sublinear}.

He reasons that the method developed in his paper doesn't seem to allow an $O(n^{1/2})$ upper bound for the worst-case $n$-gon complexity. This means there is no subsequence of $\Theta(n)$ vertices, for which we could apply Theorem~\ref{theorem:gluing} optimally.

And he also goes on explaining that \textcite{padrol2016extension} proved
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wcc}
  \wcc(d,n) \geq 2\sqrt{dn-d}-d+1 ,
\end{equation}
where $\wcc(d,n)$ is the largest possible extension complexity of a polytope with $n$ vertices in a $d$-dimensional space.
If the conjecture were false, the bound in \eqref{eq:wcc} would become asymptotically optimal for $d=2$
This is not expected, since \citeauthor{kaibel2015short} showed $\wcc(m^2,2^m) \geq 1.5^m$ for the \emph{correlation polytope} \cite{kaibel2015short}. This is asymptotically much greater than $(\sqrt{2})^m$, which is the result of equation \eqref{eq:wcc} in that case.

Thus, the question of worst-case extension complexity for polygons remains exciting.
