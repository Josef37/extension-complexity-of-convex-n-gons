\section{Concluding Remarks}
% todo: formulate

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite[Conjecture 61]{shitov2020sublinear}): $\pc(n) = n^{1/2} \cdot \alpha(n)$ with unbounded $\alpha(n)$.
  Padrol's lower bound would become tight otherwise, which isn't expected, because with growing dimensions it isn't that tight anymore...
  \item Is Shitov's bound tight or is the cyclic one valid for all $n$-gons?
  \item Shitov says that there seems to be no way to improve the bound with the methods in his paper.
  \item How about higher dimensions? Do we even get $o(n)$. Prototypical importance :)
\end{itemize}
