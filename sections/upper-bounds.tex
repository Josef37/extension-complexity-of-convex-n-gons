\begin{itemize}
  \item overview of upcoming section
  \item overview of known upper bounds
  \item history of conjectures
  \item current conjectures (intuition?)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Arbitrary Convex n-gons}

\begin{itemize}
  \item overview of Shitovs paper
  \item What is the key idea?
  \item Maximum possible result with Theorem 28
  \item Why can't one just apply Theorem 28 (and skip the rest of the paper)?
  \item Intuition for the technical part (especially definitions) through examples
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Circular n-gons}

\begin{itemize}
  \item overview of paper
  \item What is the key idea?
  \item coloring
  \item intuition of rescaling rows
  \item Higher-dimensional statements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison}

\begin{itemize}
  \item general similarities (splitting of polygons, bulging of corners)
  \item general differences (splitting by angle vs count, coloring and independece of slices in general case)
  \item How is the circle property used? Can the approach be generalised?
  \item could the general case be $O(\sqrt{n})$, too? (current conjectures)
  \item Is there a way to adopt a proof to the other case?
\end{itemize}
