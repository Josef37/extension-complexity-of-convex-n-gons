\section*{Abstract}

We examine the state of extended formulations for convex $n$-gons, focusing on bounds for the extension complexity in particular.

First, we analyze the geometric proof of the best known upper bound $\xc(P) \in O(n^{2/3})$ and present the limits of some of its theorems.

Then, we outline the linear-algebraic approach, which results in $\xc(P) \in O(n^{1/2})$ for cyclic polygons.

Finally, we provide another proof for $\xc(P) \in \Omega(n^{1/2})$ for cyclic polygons, and therefore for all polygons.
