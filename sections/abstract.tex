\section*{Abstract}
In this paper we provide an overview of the current state of the extension complexity of convex $n$-gons (i.e., two-dimensional polytopes with $n$ vertices). First we give an overview of the lower bound ($xc(P_n) \geq \sqrt{n}$) and summarize the arguments, why this is true. Then we provide a geometric visualization of Shitov's proof that $xc(P_n) \leq \frac{6}{7}n$. From that we give a geometric proof of Shitov's result that $xc(P_n) \leq o(n)$ from which we improve the known upper bound for the extension complexity of $n$-gons slightly.
