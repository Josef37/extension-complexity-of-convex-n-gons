% todo: structure and formulate

\begin{itemize}
  \item Currently known bounds for \emph{extension complexity} of $n$-gons
  \item Analyze $O(n^{2/3})$ upper bound for arbitrary $n$-gons
  \item Analyze $O(n^{1/2})$ upper bound for cyclic $n$-gons
  \item Compare both results
  \item Provide $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ lower bound for (cyclic) $n$-gons
\end{itemize}
