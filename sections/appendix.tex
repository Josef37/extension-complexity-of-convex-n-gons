\section{Proof Dependency Graph}\label{sec:dependency-graph}

The following graph gives an overview of the dependencies in the proofs of \cite{shitov2020sublinear}.

Each node corresponds to a theorem, lemma or corollary given by its number. Definitions were left out, because they would make the graph too crowded. Each edge indicates a dependency on the statement it is pointing at. Some edges could be missing, because dependencies aren't always obvious, when one is immersed in a subject for some time.
