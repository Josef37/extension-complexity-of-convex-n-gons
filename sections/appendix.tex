\section{Proof Dependency Graph}\label{sec:dependency-graph}

The following graph gives an overview of the dependencies in the proofs of \cite{shitov2020sublinear}.

Each node corresponds to a theorem, lemma or corollary given by its number.
Each edge indicates a dependency on the statement it is directed at. 
And the boxes group statements from different sections ("Sec." is short for "Section").

We left out definitions, as they would make the graph too crowded. 
Also some edges could be missing, because dependencies aren't always obvious, when one is immersed in a subject for some time.
