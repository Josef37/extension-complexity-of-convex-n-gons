\section{Proof Dependency Graph}\label{sec:dependency-graph}

The following graph gives an overview of the dependencies in the proofs from \textcite{shitov2020sublinear}.

Each node corresponds to a theorem, lemma or corollary given by its number.
Each edge indicates a dependency on the statement it is directed at.
And the boxes group statements from different sections (``Sec.'' is short for ``Section'').

Definitions were omitted, as they made the graph too crowded.
Also, some edges might be missing, because dependencies aren't always obvious, when one is immersed in a subject for some time.
