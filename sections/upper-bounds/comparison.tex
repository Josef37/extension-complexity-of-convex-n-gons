\subsection{Comparison}
% todo @ March 19 to 20

\begin{itemize}
  \item general similarities (splitting of polygons, bulging of corners)
  \item general differences (splitting by angle vs count, coloring and independece of slices in general case)
  \item How is the circle property used? Can the approach be generalised?
  \item could the general case be $O(\sqrt{n})$, too? (current conjectures)
  \item Is there a way to adopt a proof to the other case? Try Shitov's work on cyclic polygons.
\end{itemize}
