\subsection{Comparison}
% todo @ March 19 to 20

\begin{itemize}
  \item general similarities (splitting of polygons, enclosing vertices)
  \item general differences (splitting by angle vs count, iteratively finding subsequences vs considering the whole even when splitting by colors, purely geometric vs main reasoning algebraic and lemmata geometric)
  \item How does one end up at $n^{1/2}$ and the other at $n^{2/3}$. Summarize the numerical steps (asymptotically).
  \item How is the circle property used? Can the approach be generalised (replace circle distance with edge distance)?
  \item Is there a way to adopt a proof to the other case? Try Shitov's work on cyclic polygons. And try the other way around (you may have to use thin slices, too).
  \item could the general case be $O(\sqrt{n})$, too? (current conjectures)
\end{itemize}
